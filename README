"myLinksAnalyzer" is a lightweight package written in Python to 
query the LinkedIn database, extract useful information about 
your contacts, and perform some analytics over this data. 
The code also plots charts of your contacts by geographical 
location (country, city, continent etc.), profession, popular 
headline words, ... etc. The query result is stored locally in 
a text file for further analysis.

The main executable is 'analyze.py', which can be run 
on command-line in a terminal window using the command 

python analyze.py

It will produce a bunch of plots showing results from the 
analysis of your contacts. You can modify this file 
according to your needs to expand/finetune your analysis. 
You can either run a brand-new query (which is the default) 
or analyze data stored in a text file from a previous query.
